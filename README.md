## Introduction

This app was created during the team's time as students at Code Chrysalis.
<br>
<br>
As a team of developers, we want to contribute to [mymizu](https://www.mymizu.co/home-en)'s mission by creating an app that we believe, might attract more users and make mymizu more engaging.

## Main Features

1. <b>We created an avatar called Mizugocchi.</b> Mizugocchi has evolutions, that is triggered after reaching a certain number of refills. This encourages our users to refill more. Mizugocchi also has moods that depend on when the last time of your refill was.
2. <b> We created a map function </b> that enables users to search for nearby refilling spots. They are also able to see the location's information, as well as selecting it as their refill spot.
